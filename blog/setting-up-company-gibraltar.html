<h1>Setting Up a Company in Gibraltar: What You Need to Know</h1>
<div class="post-date">February 2026</div>

<p>Gibraltar has become one of the most popular jurisdictions in Europe for company formation, particularly in financial services, online gaming, fintech, and professional services. The combination of a low corporate tax rate, English-speaking business environment, common law legal system, and a well-regulated financial framework makes it attractive for entrepreneurs and established businesses alike.</p>

<p>Here's a practical overview of what's involved, what it costs, and the things you should know before you commit.</p>

<h2>Why Companies Choose Gibraltar</h2>

<p>The headline is the corporate tax rate: 15 percent. That's notably lower than the UK (25 percent), Spain (25 percent), and most Western European countries. Combined with no VAT, no capital gains tax, and no inheritance tax, the fiscal environment is competitive.</p>

<p>But tax isn't the whole story. Gibraltar offers a robust regulatory framework, particularly for financial services and gaming companies, with regulators that are respected internationally. The legal system is based on English common law, which makes it familiar and predictable for UK-based businesses. And with English as the official language, there's no translation overhead for documentation, contracts, or compliance reporting.</p>

<p>The physical location matters too. Gibraltar sits at the gateway to Africa and Southern Europe, in the same time zone as London during winter and one hour ahead in summer. It's a 2-hour flight from London and 90 minutes by car from Malaga airport.</p>

<h2>Company Formation Process</h2>

<p>The most common business structure is a private limited company, similar to a UK Ltd. The formation process is handled through the Companies House in Gibraltar and typically takes 5 to 10 working days.</p>

<p>You'll need a company name (checked for availability), at least one director (who can be of any nationality), a registered office address in Gibraltar, and a company secretary. Share capital requirements are minimal, with most companies incorporating with GBP 2,000 in authorised share capital.</p>

<p>Formation fees including government charges, registered agent fees, and the first year's registered office typically run GBP 1,500 to 3,000 depending on the complexity and which service provider you use. Annual filing and maintenance costs are roughly GBP 1,000 to 2,000 per year for a straightforward company.</p>

<h2>Licensing and Regulation</h2>

<p>Every business operating from Gibraltar needs a business licence, issued by the Office of Fair Trading. The application is straightforward for most business types and costs a nominal fee. Processing takes about 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

<p>If you're in a regulated sector (financial services, insurance, gaming, funds), you'll need additional licences from the relevant regulator, which is the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC). These applications are more involved, require a detailed business plan, proof of adequate capitalisation, and fit-and-proper person assessments for key individuals. Expect 3 to 6 months for regulated licence applications.</p>

<p>Gaming companies in particular have found Gibraltar attractive. The jurisdiction was one of the first to regulate online gambling, and its licensing regime is well-established and recognised globally.</p>

<h2>Office Space and Staffing</h2>

<p>Office space in Gibraltar is limited and not cheap. Premium space in areas like Europort, World Trade Center, or the newly developed Midtown runs GBP 25 to 40 per square foot annually. Some companies manage costs by having their regulated presence and key staff in Gibraltar while locating back-office functions in Spain.</p>

<p>Staffing draws from a pool of local Gibraltarians, British expats, and cross-border Spanish workers. For specialist roles, particularly in financial services and technology, you may need to recruit internationally and arrange work permits.</p>

<h2>Banking</h2>

<p>Opening a corporate bank account in Gibraltar has become more involved in recent years, as with most jurisdictions. Banks require thorough KYC documentation, proof of business substance, and clear source of funds. The major banks operating in Gibraltar include NatWest, Jyske Bank, and Trusted Novus Bank.</p>

<p>Allow 4 to 8 weeks for account opening, and have your documentation prepared thoroughly. Banks are particularly cautious with gaming companies and crypto-related businesses, so expect additional due diligence in those sectors.</p>

<h2>The Cross-Border Factor</h2>

<p>Many Gibraltar businesses operate with a practical footprint that extends into Spain, particularly La Linea and the surrounding area. Staff may live in Spain, warehousing or logistics may be based in Spain, and client meetings may happen on either side of the border.</p>

<p>The <a href="/blog/schengen-agreement-gibraltar">EU-UK treaty on Gibraltar</a>, provisionally approved in February 2026, will make this cross-border reality significantly easier to manage. Understanding how both jurisdictions work, from a tax, employment, and regulatory perspective, is essential for any business that straddles the border.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The practical steps are well-trodden, but the right local connections make the process faster and smoother. A good accountant, a responsive company formation agent, and someone who understands the local business landscape can save you weeks of time and avoid common pitfalls.</p>
